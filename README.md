## About Me
I am Anthony K. Daniels, an accomplished Business and IT Management professional with over 18 years of experience in telecommunications and IT operations. Currently, I hold the role of Systems Technician at ATT, where I have dedicated myself to optimizing operations and ensuring the seamless delivery of business telecommunications products. Throughout my tenure, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to efficiency and cost-effectiveness, exemplified by internalizing project work to reduce costs and leading initiatives that significantly enhance system reliability.

My journey in IT and telecommunications has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a proactive approach to problem-solving. As a former Senior Sales Consultant and Facilities Specialist at ATT, I honed my skills in customer service, sales strategy, and facilities management, consistently exceeding performance targets and contributing to organizational success.

I recently earned a Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning from MIT, specializing in predictive analytics, recommendation systems, and deep learning. This academic achievement reflects my passion for leveraging data-driven insights to drive decision-making and operational efficiency.

As a Division 1 collegiate athlete, I bring a competitive spirit and a strong work ethic to everything I do. I thrive in challenging environments where I can continually improve and achieve new heights of success. My background in leadership and team management further complements my technical skills, allowing me to effectively lead cross-functional teams and drive collaborative efforts towards achieving strategic objectives.

Outside of work, my greatest motivation comes from my family. They inspire me to push boundaries and strive for continuous improvement, not only for personal growth but also to provide them with a stable and prosperous future.

I am eager to transition into a Technology Management or entry-level Data Scientist role where I can apply my analytical prowess, leadership experience, and technical acumen to contribute to innovative projects and drive business outcomes through data-driven insights.
